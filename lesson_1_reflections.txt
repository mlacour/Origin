How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It was awesome. It'll be a great help comparing my code files.



How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Allows me to revert back in case of a mistake.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros:
The commits are more meaningful. 

Cons:
you can easily forget to save. In case of a system failure (involuntary shut down) you may also lose your work.




Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?


They serve different purposes. Coding typically involve interralated files which is often not the case in other professions.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

I'd use log with --stat to quickly see what happened and diff to go into the details of comparing 2 files.




How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

It would cause I'd know i can revert back.
