When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to access it from multiple places. 
When I want to have it available anytime from anywhere
When other people need to have access to it


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I might have made uncommitted changes to my local files.
I want to be able to keep track of everything that's happening


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork clones directly on github and allows to recognize previous work by other people. i'd use it when i want to build on that previous work without modifying the original

Clone copies from online to local or local to local. 

Branch allows to work from a specific commit and experiment.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It allows to compare the files on my computer with those on the internet, especially if some changes have been made by other people.
