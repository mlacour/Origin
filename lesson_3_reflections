When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to access it from multiple places. 
When I want to have it available anytime from anywhere
When other people need to have access to it


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I might have made uncommitted changes to my local files.
I want to be able to keep track of everything that's happening
